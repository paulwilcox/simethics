## Distractions

Many things have been pulling us away from a deep study of utilitarian ethics using 
non-exotic logic (i.e. simple mathematics, set-theory, and modern logic).

- We rely on our intuition to decide whether propositions are correct or not (but 
  our intuitions lead to contradictions).
- We worry that our propositions will justify evil actions (but the greatest examples
  of where it does (Facism, American Eugenics) demonstrate bad philosophers, not bad 
  philosophy).
- We are not sufficiently focused on practical ethical philosophy (some exotic 
  hypothetical with no risk of manifesting in a real situation delivers too-strong
  a blow to the motivation to study a philosophy that can be useful when appied to 
  practical situations).
- Some determinations that logic is not sufficient to model ethics don't seem to 
  consider allowing mathematics into the analysis (but mathematics is now shown to be
  founded on logic and set theory, so why not permit it's use in determining whether
  ethics can be founded on the same?).

## From neural-networks to set-theory

- TODO: Investigate whether I should be working with category-theory or neural networks
  from the start
- TODO: If not, then explain how really this involves neural networks, but these can be 
  translated to (fuzzy) logic and set-theory, and the latter is easier to theorize with 
  and to develop an axiomatic system for.

## The Origin

Our perceptions constitute a simple set 

- A subset of these perceptions involves pains and pleasures
- These provide the motivations to observe the set.
- They also provide motivations to change the set, but we do not yet know how.
- The set of perceptions at any point in time commenses as a set of pure perceptions, 
  so no nesting of sets.
- Perceptions between points in time can possibly be represented as multiple sets.
  But I lean toward representing it all as one set, but as a fuzzy set with full weight 
  to present-time elements and degraded weight for past-time elements.  I see two tracks 
  to time:
    * At a pre-conusious level, the brain does primitively work with plural sets to contrast 
      time in order to build a perception of 'difference' or 'direction' that then enters 
      primitively at the conscious level.  But at this stage it's not recognized as 
      'difference' or 'direction'.  It would just be instinctively known to be not the 
      same as another perception that is otherwise identical except does not have this 
      feature.
    * At a conscious level, fuzzy-set logic is used and a full-weighted perception appears 
      alongside a partially weighted perception of the same nature.  But at this stage, the 
      association is unnoticed: it is just two elements in a set of perceptions.  But later 
      they get associated to create 'time'.

We identify patterns in our sets to create conceptual and instinctual 'objects' 

- These objects have core and peripheral perceptions involved, and are flexible.
- At more advanced stages we can make 'categories' and 'abstractions', and relatedly (or 
  perhaps synnonymously), objects can be defined by a 'building' rule as opposed to just
  an explicit listing of perceptions and other objects.
- Objects don't have to be conscious, though I am biased to speak of them as such.

We can put placeholders in our sets

- Perceptive sets that are very close to created objects can be represented downward 
  (ignoring elements) or upward (adding elements).  
    * This is reflexive imagination 
    * A fuller form of imagination in line with our understanding of it comes with 'control',
      described later.
    * When 'time' as a concept is understood, and imagination is applied, the 'future' can be 
      constructed.
- A 'placeholder' is possible in an object.
    * An abstraction may seem to be in order, but the best one might be ambiguous:
    * Imagine an infant encoutering the following objects
        > needle: { 'pointy', 'silver', 'pain' }, 
        > knife: { 'flat', 'silver', 'pain' }
        > spoon: { 'round', 'silver', 'pleasure' }
        > plate: { 'round', 'flat', 'white', 'pleasure' }
        > finger: { 'pointy', 'peachy', 'pleasure' }
    * This infant best not be afraid of all silver things, but best be afraid of some silver 
      things.  And yet, in seeking the completion to { 'silver', ..., 'pain' }, neither 
      'pointy' nor 'flat' is appropriate becasue they can lead to pleasurable things.
    * A { 'silver', null, 'pain' } could possiby be created and sometimes can be useful.
      But novel perceptive-sets with 'silver' and some other property might easily not lead
      to pain, making the set with the placeholder weak in terms of utility.
    * A { 'silver', { 'pointy' or 'flat' }, 'pain' } object would be more useful.  
    * A { 'silver', not-'round', 'pain' } object would also be more useful, and far more 
      efficient if the ambiguity is with mroe than just two items.  
    * But a 'not' element can but doesn't have to bring up perceptions to the mind.  It can
      be 'blank' or 'dark' in the mind but still be useful.  This is a 'placeholder'.
    * Placeholders aren't just from 'not' elements, that was just an example of how to
      come to one.  
    * TODO: maybe a better or added exmaple that isn't 'not' based.    

We discover that we have 'control' over some perceptions, and not others.

- We simply desire a change in perception, and it happens.
- The origin of this control is not consiously known.  
- The actions required to cause a change are often too complex for this stage to handle.  So
  reflexes are in-built that allow the plural actions to act as one.  
- Example.  An infant percieves the pain of hunger, and a built-in apparatus makes it cry.
  Soon after, a perception of pleasure or relief follows (due to the milk, though the newborn
  does not know of 'milk').  No 'control' yet.  But, with enough events, a lesser pain of 
  hunger that does not trigger the apparatus is nevertheless invoked by the infant.  Pleasure
  follows.
- Note that 'control' isn't just simply an object, category, or abstraction that assembles 
  related perceptions into a set.  
    * Most primitively on the same level as a 'perception', although not a perception.  
    * It is a non-percieved element that can go into a set.  
    * When in a set it initially does nothing (well, what it does is not in the realm of 
      perception), but soon it changes perceptions.
- Though unpercieved, it can become part of object-sets by virtue of 'placeholder' logic.  
  This would be a hinderance to how often or quickly it is uses, but because of it's
  effectiveness on other perceptions and ultimately to pain and pleasure, it happens more 
  quickly than otherwise.  
- A control-abstraction (e.g. 'my finger', where finger has a 'control' placeholder) should 
  be differentiated from a control-primitive.  A control-primitive means you added a control 
  element to a set, and this can happen at the most primitive stages, though it goes unnoticed 
  to the sentient being.  A control-abstraction is an object that was created because learning 
  processes have used a placeholder to capture the effect of the control primitive.  
  A control-primitive initiates action in the real world.  A control-abstraction does not and 
  furthermore has no direct 'knowledge' of the nature of the control-primitive that gave rise
  to it. 

'Self' is no new construct.  It is merely an 'object', though one of special interest:

- We initially create it out of the perceptions that couple with pleasure and pain.
- Example: An infant has created the 'long', 'thin', 'silver', 'soft' mental categories.  It 
  observes a few 'silver-thin-longs' ('needles' to us) and a few 'soft-fat-longs' ('fingers' to 
  us).  When a 'silver-thin-long' touches any 'soft-fat-long', pain often arises.  But when it 
  touches a variety of other things, no new sensation arises.  Eventually, a set of things that 
  act like 'soft-fat-longs' are grouped into the same conceptual object.  And this is the birth 
  of 'self'.  (Note that I really believe this starts at the fetal level, and is probably 
  already fairly advanced at the infant level, though it has to undergo drastic change to 
  account for the new input of perseptions).
- As with any other mental object, the set is flexible and evolving.  
- Example: At a more advanced stage an infant will understand 'hair'.  But needles and other 
  objects (scissors) don't cause pain in 'hair'.  Nevertheless, 'hair' is accepted as part of 
  'self' because of other properties it shares with 'self' elements.       


which leads to the
  category of 'self'.  The category of self is a good strategy in pleasure/pain optimization.  It's past 
  success leaves it fairly rigid and hard to change.  It's continued success requres that it be changeable
  nevertheless, as different ways to identify the self may be more successful and the present way may have 
  some drawbacks (i.e. defining the 'self' as being 'always nice to others' can work well in early years 
  but lead to disrespect from others if never modified).
- We learn that other categories seem to behave as our 'self' does, and so we come to learn that other 
  selves exist.  
- We learn that some of our categories persist, but evolve, over time.  Peripheral properties change, but
  core ones remain stable.  This causes us to recognize a past self and to anticipate a future self.  
- We can intelectually identify with things, or we can additionally motivationally identify with them.  
  We learn that expanding our identity to the short-term future self is very effective in improving the 
  condition of that future self.  So this is one of our first experiences in expanding our identity 
  and consideration beyond what is immediately required.  
- The birth of ethics is when, in addition to expanding our identity to our future self, we also expand it
  to have concern for the pain and pleasure of the other 'selves'.  
  

TODO: some thoughts below might better be subsumed into earlier points, then re-referenced.

This happens for the following reasons:
    * One self has learned that the consideration of the pleasure of other selves causes them to in turn 
      consider his/her own pleasure.
    * One self has expanded his/her identity to include other selves directly, so that the pleasure or
      pain of the other self immediately causes pleasure or pain in the self.
    * One self has other selves as an interest, but not identity.  

## Happiness for just some or all other 'selves'?

## The Broad Goal: Should overall happiness be summed or averaged?

- If averaged, then we should develop a secret plan to kill all people who are less happy than the happiest.
- If summed, then millions of barely above-neutral people is better than one extremely happy person.

In the former, we seem to have far less trouble considering not birthing less happy potential people than we 
do killing existing less happy people.

The latter has been referred to as the 'repugnant conclusion'.  But repugnant in what sense?  By definition,
the millions of barely above-neutral people are positive.  Even if you 'rounded-off' to pure neutral you 
don't get to 'repugnant', which is negative.  So it must be relative.  The lost happiness for any individual
person.  

Also, I suspect that despite Parfit's claim that there is no minimum threshold of happiness, such 
as would make imperceptible happiness something to be considered differently than perceptible happiness, 
imagined imperceptibility of the happniness is what's going on here to make it a powerful hypothetical.
Consider just the first half of the slipperly slope taken together: one extremely happy individual has 
100 offspring and his happiness and that of his offspring then all suddenly become considerably happy but 
not extremely happy.  It is not easy to judge the first individual as having acted right or wrong.  It is
hard because there's no real criteria, and because there is no issue with perceptibility of happiness 
because 'considerably' happy is perfecty perceptible.
