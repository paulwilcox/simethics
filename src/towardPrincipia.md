## Distractions

Many things have been pulling us away from a deep study of utilitarian ethics using 
non-exotic logic (i.e. simple mathematics, set-theory, and modern logic).

- We rely on our intuition to decide whether propositions are correct or not (but 
  our intuitions lead to contradictions).
- We worry that our propositions will justify evil actions (but the greatest examples
  of where it does (Facism, American Eugenics) demonstrate bad philosophers, not bad 
  philosophy).
- We are not sufficiently focused on practical ethical philosophy (some exotic 
  hypothetical with no risk of manifesting in a real situation delivers too-strong
  a blow to the motivation to study a philosophy that can be useful when appied to 
  practical situations).
- Some determinations that logic is not sufficient to model ethics don't seem to 
  consider allowing mathematics into the analysis (but mathematics is now shown to be
  founded on logic and set theory, so why not permit it's use in determining whether
  ethics can be founded on the same?).

## From neural-networks to set-theory

- TODO: Explain how really this involves neural networks, but these can be translated 
  to (fuzzy) logic and set-theory, and the latter is easier to theorize with and to 
  develop an axiomatic system for.

## The Origin

### Primitives

TODO: Is the reliance on perceptive set too strong here?  Seems that objects in the perceptive
  set can be mixed in with non-perceptive objects.  
TODO: 'ordering' was defined late in this game.  As a result, 'habits' is poory defined, and in 
  turn I"m having trouble with 'time'. 

Our perceptions constitute a simple set 

- A subset of these perceptions involves pains and pleasures
- These provide the motivations to observe the set.
- They also provide motivations to change the set, but we do not yet know how.
- The set of perceptions at any point in time commenses as a set of pure perceptions, 
  so no nesting of sets.
- Perceptions between points in time can possibly be represented as multiple sets.
  But I lean toward representing it all as one set, but as a fuzzy set with full weight 
  to present-time elements and degraded weight for past-time elements.  I see two tracks 
  to time:
    * At a pre-conusious level, the brain does primitively work with plural sets to contrast 
      time in order to build a perception of 'difference' or 'direction' that then enters 
      primitively at the conscious level.  But at this stage it's not recognized as 
      'difference' or 'direction'.  It would just be instinctively known to be not the 
      same as another perception that is otherwise identical except does not have this 
      feature.
    * At a conscious level, fuzzy-set logic is used and a full-weighted perception appears 
      alongside a partially weighted perception of the same nature.  But at this stage, the 
      association is unnoticed: it is just two elements in a set of perceptions.  But later 
      they get associated to create 'time'.

We identify patterns in our sets to create conceptual and instinctual 'objects' 

- These objects have core and peripheral perceptions involved, and are flexible.
- At more advanced stages we can make 'categories' and 'abstractions', and relatedly (or 
  perhaps synnonymously), objects can be defined by a 'building' rule as opposed to just
  an explicit listing of perceptions and other objects.
- Objects don't have to be conscious, though I am biased to speak of them as such.
- Our motivation for creating these objects initially comes from how intense pleasure and
  pain couples with other perceptions, to create objects with pain and pleasure as elements.
  But it is also advantageous to create objects without pain and pleasure as elements in 
  order to couple them, as a whole, to pain and pleasure or to other objects with pain
  and pleasure.
- The 'element of' operation of set-theory doesn't exist in our instinctive apparati.  
  For us, it is non recursive.  So given 'A: { x, B: { y, z } }', mathematically it would
  be inaccurate for us to say 'z is an element of A'.  Rather, we should say, 'z is 
  an element of an element of A'.  But our minds are more easily  capable of the former.
  Vulnerabilites such as this shouldn't change the theory of the ideal.  But it should 
  change the theory of the practical.   
- Perceptive sets that are very close to created objects can be represented downward 
  (ignoring elements) or upward (adding elements).  

Objects can be ordered sets

- This might happen in different ways.  I don't want to commit to it being one way or the 
  other.  So I declare ordering here primitively.
- But, it might not be primitive.  Mathematically, ordered sets aren't primitive.  But 
  the way ordering derives neurolgically is probably not the way ordering is typicaly
  derived in set-theory.  

TODO: Objects can be incomplete

We have 'habits'

- When we create objects, there is a process that stores these, and a process that recalls them.
- Storage is simple.  A set exists of stored objects.  This exists outside of the perceptive 
  set.  Any object can be stored, including ones with explicit perceptions, set-builder logic 
  that can invoke other perceptions, control-primitives that when recalled would invoke action,
  orderings.  
- Recall is a pattern matching reaction that takes items from our perceptive set as input, 
  invokes an object in storage as throughput, and places it into our perceptive set as output.  
- Two tracks to this object activation:
    * An object full of new perceptions not in the current perceptive set is manifested.
    * An object full of existing perceptions found in the current perceptive set is created.
    * And of course there is the hybrid path
- Later, we define control-primitives.  Habits can store these, which allows 'habits' to take
  on their traditional sense (which involves actions).  But stored objects without 
  control-primitives (such as memories) I will call habits as well.

We can put placeholders in our sets

- An abstraction may seem to be in order, but the best one might be ambiguous:
- Imagine an infant encoutering the following objects
    > needle: { 'pointy', 'silver', 'pain' }, 
    > knife: { 'flat', 'silver', 'pain' }
    > spoon: { 'round', 'silver', 'pleasure' }
    > plate: { 'round', 'flat', 'white', 'pleasure' }
    > finger: { 'pointy', 'peachy', 'pleasure' }
- This infant best not be afraid of all silver things, but best be afraid of some silver 
    things.  And yet, in seeking the completion to { 'silver', ..., 'pain' }, neither 
    'pointy' nor 'flat' is appropriate becasue they can lead to pleasurable things.
- A { 'silver', null, 'pain' } could possiby be created and sometimes can be useful.
    But novel perceptive-sets with 'silver' and some other property might easily not lead
    to pain, making the set with the placeholder weak in terms of utility.
- A { 'silver', { 'pointy' or 'flat' }, 'pain' } object would be more useful.  
- A { 'silver', not-'round', 'pain' } object would also be more useful, and far more 
    efficient if the ambiguity is with mroe than just two items.  
- But a 'not' element can but doesn't have to bring up perceptions to the mind.  It can
    be 'blank' or 'dark' in the mind but still be useful.  This is a 'placeholder'.
- Placeholders aren't just from 'not' elements, that was just an example of how to
    come to one.  
- TODO: maybe a better or added exmaple that isn't 'not' based.  
- TODO: Account for the need to use identifiers to distinguish placeholders.
- TODO: Placeholders can be pointers to other objects.  This may be important in 'habits'
  later as it permits the benefits of including an object in another object without 
  invoking the full force of the object (e.g. if one object has a control-primitive, 
  including it in another object would invoke that control, wheras a placeholder will 
  only provide the link to that control-including object without invoking the 
  control-primitive). 

We discover that we have 'control' over some perceptions, and not others.

- We simply desire a change in perception, and it happens.  This is either by a new perception
  directly entering a set (memory/imagination), or by an object in the real-world able to be
  influenced by us in turn changing other aspects of the outside world that influence our 
  perception (but we do not initially know 'memory', 'imagination', or 'the outside world').
- The origin of this control is not consiously known.  
- The actions required to cause a change are often too complex for this stage to handle.  So
  reflexes are in-built that allow the plural actions to act as one.  
- Example.  An infant percieves the pain of hunger, and a built-in apparatus makes it cry.
  Soon after, a perception of pleasure or relief follows (due to the milk, though the newborn
  does not know of 'milk').  No 'control' yet.  But, with enough events, a lesser pain of 
  hunger that does not trigger the apparatus is nevertheless invoked by the infant.  Pleasure
  follows.
- Note that 'control' isn't just simply an object, category, or abstraction that assembles 
  related perceptions into a set.  
    * Most primitively on the same level as a 'perception', although not a perception.  
    * It is a non-percieved element that can go into a set.  
    * When in a set it initially does nothing (well, what it does is not in the realm of 
      perception), but soon it changes perceptions.
- Though unpercieved, it can become part of object-sets by virtue of 'placeholder' logic.  
  This would be a hinderance to how often or quickly it is uses, but because of it's
  effectiveness on other perceptions and ultimately to pain and pleasure, it happens more 
  quickly than otherwise.  
- A control-abstraction (e.g. 'my finger', where finger has a 'control' placeholder) should 
  be differentiated from a control-primitive.  A control-primitive means you added a control 
  element to a set, and this can happen at the most primitive stages, though it goes unnoticed 
  to the sentient being.  A control-abstraction is an object that was created because learning 
  processes have used a placeholder to capture the effect of the control primitive.  
  A control-primitive initiates action in the real world.  A control-abstraction does not and 
  furthermore has no direct 'knowledge' of the nature of the control-primitive that gave rise
  to it. 
- A control-primitive can also be a control-blocker.  In other words, a control-primitive can 
  be applied to another control-primitive and have the effect of blocking the latter.

### Composites

'Reality' is not a new class.

- Objects in our perceptive set can have elements with strongly-weighted perceptions, and 
  elements with weakly-weighted perceptions.  
- We learn that properties often cluster by this weighting.  And we are motivated to learn
  that because pleasure and pain is included in this clustering behavior.
- A 'strength-in-perception' placeholder is created that allows us to imagine 
  strongly percieved objects even though they are not strongly-percieved.  
- We later learn that there are in fact objects with strong perceptions and ones with 
  weak perceptions that behave differently than we expect.  So we know that there is 
  'something' that is strongly related to 'strength-in-perception' but is not exactly 
  equal to it.  'There-is-something' is synnonimous with having created a placeholder.
  This is the 'reality' placeholder.  It later gets converted into an object with a 
  placeholder in it, as we learn more things that we are comfortable including in 'reality'.

'Imagination' is not a new class.

- The already-defined act of creating objects by adding new elements to old objects and taking 
  away elements from old objets is at least an instinctive imagination done as a reflex.
- Add to that the control-primitive defined above, apply it to this ability to create objects.
- Further apply the 'reality' object, in this case lowly-rated reality objects, to imagination
  objects.
- With this you have an imaginative capacity in the more traditional sense.
- It should be mentioned that lowly-rated 'reality' is not mandatory.  Object-permanence, for
  instance, is an example of imagination (creating objects via control-primitive), that has 
  a highly-weighted 'reality' element.  

'Time' is not a new class.  

- habits involve 

- Strongly-percieved objects lead to the formation of habits.
- Habits, in turn, give rise to weakly-percieved objects (memories, though not yet known as 
  such) that look like strongly percieved ones.
- The latter correlate strongly with the former, in the sense that differences in the 
  weakly-percieved objects become predictive of differences in their strongly-percieved 
  counterparts in a way that the reverse is not true.
- An ordering is identified with weakly-percieved objects preceding strongly-percieved ones.
- The weakly-percieved objects are then recognized as 'past' and strongly percieved ones
  as 'now'.




- When 'time' as a concept is understood, and imagination is applied, the 'future' can be 
    constructed.

'Identity' is not a new class.

'Self' is not a new class.

- We initially create it out of the perceptions that couple with pleasure and pain.
- Example: An infant has created the 'long', 'thin', 'silver', 'soft' mental categories.  It 
  observes a few 'silver-thin-longs' ('needles' to us) and a few 'soft-fat-longs' ('fingers' to 
  us).  When a 'silver-thin-long' touches any 'soft-fat-long', pain often arises.  But when it 
  touches a variety of other things, no new sensation arises.  Eventually, a set of things that 
  act like 'soft-fat-longs' are grouped into the same conceptual object.  And this is the birth 
  of 'self'.  (Note that I really believe this starts at the fetal level, and is probably 
  already fairly advanced at the infant level, though it has to undergo drastic change to 
  account for the new input of perseptions).
- As with any other mental object, the set is flexible and evolving.  
- Example: At a more advanced stage an infant will understand 'hair'.  But needles and other 
  objects (scissors) don't cause pain in 'hair'.  Nevertheless, 'hair' is accepted as part of 
  'self' because of other properties it shares with 'self' elements.       
- The object of 'self' is the best strategy in pleasure/pain optimization.  It's past success 
  leaves it fairly rigid and hard to change.  It's continued success requres that it be 
  changeable nevertheless, as different ways to identify the self may be more successful and 
  the present way may have some drawbacks (i.e. defining the 'self' as being 'always nice to 
  others' can work well in early years but lead to disrespect from others if never modified).
- We learn that other objects have similar properties as our 'self' does, and that the most 
  successful way to work with these other objects is to understand that they behave, in 
  very simiar ways to our own 'selves'.






- We learn that some of our categories persist, but evolve, over time.  Peripheral properties change, but
  core ones remain stable.  This causes us to recognize a past self and to anticipate a future self.  
- We can intelectually identify with things, or we can additionally motivationally identify with them.  
  We learn that expanding our identity to the short-term future self is very effective in improving the 
  condition of that future self.  So this is one of our first experiences in expanding our identity 
  and consideration beyond what is immediately required.  
- The birth of ethics is when, in addition to expanding our identity to our future self, we also expand it
  to have concern for the pain and pleasure of the other 'selves'.  
  

- ... This happens for the following reasons:
    * One self has learned that the consideration of the pleasure of other selves causes them to in turn 
      consider his/her own pleasure.
    * One self has expanded his/her identity to include other selves directly, so that the pleasure or
      pain of the other self immediately causes pleasure or pain in the self.
    * One self has other selves as an interest, but not identity.  

'Interest', 'Meaning', and 'Value' are not new classes

### Conjectures

Consciousness IS a new class

- It has been proposed that consciousness has something to do with the ability to form a concept
  of 'self' or to reflect on oneself.  Does a grasshopper or a nat have a sense of self?  If not, are they 
  not conscious?  Seems hard to believe, and certainly hard to say with confidence that they are zombies. 
- Consider the jhanas.  In the analysis above, it seems their effect is basically to unwrap all
  objects, then then to eliminate everything from the perceptive set.  And yet it seems there's 
  still consciousness there (is the goal of the meditator doing this really to have the same 
  effect as non-consciousness?).  So it cannot be described in terms of any of the primitives 
  or composites described here, which inclues 'self' and many other things.
- Maybe it is necessitated (but not fully explained) by the fact that 'member-of' operations are
  not efficient in the pattern matching operations described.  A 'recursive-member-of' operation
  is required.  But for that to be efficient, the members need to be unwrapped.  Furthermore, 
  they cannot be unwrapped in a way that double counts the perceptions when the same ones occur
  in different objects.  So a keeping-track of the inputs needs to occur, and percetive
  consciousness might be the space that houses that. 

## Happiness for just some or all other 'selves'?

## The Broad Goal: Should overall happiness be summed or averaged?

- If averaged, then we should develop a secret plan to kill all people who are less happy than the happiest.
- If summed, then millions of barely above-neutral people is better than one extremely happy person.

In the former, we seem to have far less trouble considering not birthing less happy potential people than we 
do killing existing less happy people.

The latter has been referred to as the 'repugnant conclusion'.  But repugnant in what sense?  By definition,
the millions of barely above-neutral people are positive.  Even if you 'rounded-off' to pure neutral you 
don't get to 'repugnant', which is negative.  So it must be relative.  The lost happiness for any individual
person.  

Also, I suspect that despite Parfit's claim that there is no minimum threshold of happiness, such 
as would make imperceptible happiness something to be considered differently than perceptible happiness, 
imagined imperceptibility of the happniness is what's going on here to make it a powerful hypothetical.
Consider just the first half of the slipperly slope taken together: one extremely happy individual has 
100 offspring and his happiness and that of his offspring then all suddenly become considerably happy but 
not extremely happy.  It is not easy to judge the first individual as having acted right or wrong.  It is
hard because there's no real criteria, and because there is no issue with perceptibility of happiness 
because 'considerably' happy is perfecty perceptible.
