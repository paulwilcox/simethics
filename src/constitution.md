# Introduction

My ultimate goal is to build an ethical system from first principles.
My work in other areas (in this project, for "objectProcessing" and
"towardPrincipia") is to that end.

However, that is proving very complex and my time due is proving very 
limited.  So I can't wait until that project is done before I start 
entertaining other areas.  And yet I'm interested in other areas, and
often I get just burnt out on the first principles.  So I'm proceeding
with this constitutional area now, which is motivating to me.  Right 
now, it will invovle some thougths I've had since early adulthood about 
creating a good political constitution.  It will not be rigorous at
this point.  By this I mean it will not be linked to first principles
and not simulated.  But that is the end goal.

# Checks and Balances

In the United States, a philosophy of separation of powers motivates 
the division of branches of government between legislative, executive, 
and judicial responsibilities.  The federal/state division should be
added to this mix, as the states, in their domain, can limit the
federal government just as the other branches do.
